Release notes

In general: update them just before setting a tag:
git tag -a vx.y.z

Describe the changes (the motivation) which motiviated this tag.
The same information should be added into this file, so that
the tag has the "diff" of ReleaseNotes.txt, kind of.

It is probably a good idea to set a new tag with every new feature.
The first digit should be increased, when there are non compatible changes:
  Things had been removed, code that had been moved inside the code tree,
  so that a project will not compile without further changes.
The second digit will be inccreased when a new feature had been added,
which will reset the third digit to 0.
(The word digit is wrong. We can have 2.11.13 or so)

The 3rd digit will be increased, when there is a pure bugfix.
