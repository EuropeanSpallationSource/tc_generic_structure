Release notes

In general: update them just before setting a tag:
git tag -a vx.y.z

Describe the changes (the motivation) which motiviated this tag.
The same information should be added into this file, so that
the tag has the "diff" of ReleaseNotes.txt, kind of.

It is probably a good idea to set a new tag with every new feature.
The first digit should be increased, when there are non compatible changes:
  Things had been removed, code that had been moved inside the code tree,
  so that a project will not compile without further changes.
The second digit will be inccreased when a new feature had been added,
which will reset the third digit to 0.
(The word digit is wrong. We can have 2.11.13 or so)

The 3rd digit will be increased, when there is a pure bugfix.
See v2.0.0 vs 2.0.1

v2.9.1
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.9.0
- Improvements:
  - Change the ENUMs in the GVL_APP and in the Axis_template from just the simple integer
    value, to the explicit variable name to make the code easier to understand.

v2.9.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.9.0
- New features:
  - Include in the solution tree all the new FBs for all ESS cabinets monitoring (MBP3-12).
  - Add TcLinkTo attribute to the I/O variables in Safety_Shutter program (Issue 8).
  - Add to Axis_template lines to configure:
    - Auto-enable axis when move starts
	- Auto-disable axis when move is done or stopped
	- Brake and Airpad configuration
	- Homing switch mode
	- Clutch example
	- Power for encoders

v2.8.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.8.0
- New features:
  - Cabinet_Monitoring (renamed from Cabinet_Configuration) program to call the monitoring FBs.
  - Add TcLinkTo attribute to the variables in the Shutter_Opertaor_Panel program.
  - Includes in solution tree FB_ESSMonitoringMCU5001a.
  - Add to GVL_APP the pressure group pressure limits variables and allow time for pressure out 
    of range variable.
  - Pneumatic_Box program that contains the variables for the pressure sensors and pressure limits
    calculations and signals.
  - Add Safety_Shutter program. It is a modified version of Pneuamtics_Template modified for PSS safety
    related shutter. It inlcudes the variables needed for the PSS permit signals.
- Improvements:
  - Update Pneumatics_Template to reflect the variable changes: Pressure limits, retract and 
    extract times, allow pressure out of range, pressure groups.
  - Change name of configuration variable form bPneumaticsAxisShutter to bSafetyShutter.
  - Delete the negation of the PSS Permit light in the Shutter_Operator_Panel program and set the
    index of the GVL.astPneumaticAxes to 1.
  - Link the tAllowTimePressureOutOfRange, stPneumaticAxisConfig.fLow/HighLimitPressureValue to the
    corresponding variables of GVL_APP.

v2.7.0
- Version tag skipped to match the version tag in tc_mca_std_lib. After that both version tags will match.

v2.6.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.7.0
- New features:
  - Update MAIN.sVersion to 2.6.0 to match tag version.
  - Add Release notes file for tc_generic_structure changes.
  - Includes DUTs for:
      Backlash compensation (MBP-167).
	  Read/Write CoE Parameters from motor Drive (MBP-271).
  - Add variable nTestNum in MAIN. The variable is used in the ESS's FAT_SAT_tools python scripts (MBP-295).
  
- Improvements:
  - Solved WARNINGS related to the VAR_IN_OUT in the FB_PneumaticAxis (MBP-292).
  - Add missing comments and improved comments for the variables in MAIN and GVL_APP and Application Specific POUs (MBP-257).

v2.5.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.6.0
- Improvements:
  - Clean and simplify Shutter Operator Panel Template.
  - Clean and improve Axis_template:
	  Delete the variables related to PILS.
	  Add the variables and comments related to advanced homing configuration.
	  Add the new variable bEnableStopWithAnyLimitSwitch.
  - Update GlobalTextList to support the new button bEnableStopWithAnyLimitSwitch in MAINVISU

v2.4.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.5.0
- Improvements:
  - Add commented variables to the Pneumatics_Template(PRG), as a template for pneumatic axis setup.
  - Remove Product version line from the files.
- New features:
  - Add support for c6017 ups in Restore Position code (MBP-273).
  - Add Shutter Operator panel Template, inlcudes the behavior of the LEDs on the panel code.

v2.3.0
- Compatible with tc_mca_std_lib v2.4.0
- Improvements:
  - Set PLC options:
	  Update the project version to 4024.56.
	  Change compiler version to "latest version".
	  Select the option "Minimize the Id changes in TwinCAT files" to get rid of the changes in the id hash.
	  Add ST_HomingConfig to the solution file structure.
	  Update all libraries placeholders to latest version.
	  The option "Clear invlaid persistent data" is set to true.
